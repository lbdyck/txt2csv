TXT2CSV is a simple REXX exec that works with both z/OS and z/VM to
convert a sequential dataset, or PDS member, to a new output file in CSV
format.

If under z/OS ISPF then an ISPF panel can be invoked to assist with
filling in all the options required for TXT2CSV to operate.

Installation:

Execute the zginstall.rex from the OMVS directory after cloning to
create the z/OS datasets.

Installation:
   1. Copy the restored EXEC member into your SYSEXEC (or SYSPROC) library
   2. Copy the restored PANELS members into your ISPPLIB library

Notes:
   1. Thanks to :hilippe Lignot for the ISPF panel which I've enhanced and
      added a tutorial panel to it.
